# CampingBD

This Demo project is mainly based on an Tourism related platform. In this platform we can book cmapsites easily. IT will show us various services according to the facilities the CampingBd site will give us. And one can easily view all the Campsites and fascilitites . I tried to update the project using React , react-router for practice purpose. Here I practiced some new thing also like privateRoute, ContextApi, AuthProvider, Firebase etc. The main purpose behind making this site was practicing express.js.

## Run The Project
=> First you have to install NPM and React(if your computer doesn't have NPM and React installed already).

### `npm start`
